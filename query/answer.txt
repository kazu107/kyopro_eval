The error you're experiencing is due to the fact that the code is trying to calculate the divisors of A and B using a recursive approach, which is not necessary in this case.

Here's an updated version of the code that calculates the counts of "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" directly without using recursion:

```python
import math

def solve(N, A, B):
    count_A = N // A
    count_B = N // B
    count_FB = N // (A * B)
    count_A -= count_FB
    count_B -= count_FB
    return count_A
